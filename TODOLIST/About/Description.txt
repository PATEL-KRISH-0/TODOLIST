how code works :-

This code is a JavaScript function that handles the addition, deletion, editing, and checking of to-do list items in an HTML document. It provides functionality for a basic to-do list application.

The addtodo() function is triggered when a user wants to add a new to-do item. It first checks if the input field is empty and displays an alert if so. Otherwise, it retrieves the text from the input field and appends a new list item to the HTML document, displaying the text along with checkboxes, an edit button, and a delete button.

The deleteTodo() function is called when the user clicks the delete button associated with a specific to-do item. It removes the corresponding list item from the HTML document.

The editTodo() function allows the user to edit the text of a to-do item. When the edit button is clicked, a prompt appears asking for the new text. If the user enters a new text (not null), the function updates the list item's text with the new input.

The checkCheckBox() function is used to mark a to-do item as completed by crossing out the text. When the checkbox is checked, the function adds a <del> HTML tag around the text to visually indicate completion. If the checkbox is unchecked, the function removes the <del> tag to revert the appearance.

Overall, this code provides the essential functionality for managing a to-do list in a web application. It demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM, handle user interactions, and update the HTML dynamically using JavaScript.
